## üöÄ Features

- **Train from scratch** a classifier on a labeled dataset of government ID images.
- **Evaluate** model performance and view classification metrics.
- **Run inference** on new images for quick predictions.
- **Easy-to-use CLI scripts** for seamless integration.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/krishdef7/Government-ID-Classifier.git
   cd Government‚ÄëID‚ÄëClassifier
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

>  *Note:* If you're using GPU for training, ensure relevant versions of TensorFlow or PyTorch are installed (depending on your code implementation).

## üèãÔ∏è Usage

### 1. Training the Model

Train a classifier using your labeled dataset:

```bash
python train.py   --data PATH/TO/your_dataset.csv   --image-dir PATH/TO/images/   --target CLASS_COLUMN   --model-out models/id_classifier.joblib   --report-out models/classification_report.txt
```

- `--data`: CSV file containing at least two columns: `filename`, and `label`.
- `--image-dir`: Directory path where images referenced in CSV are stored.
- `--target`: Column name in CSV with the class labels.
- `--model-out`: Destination path for the trained model file.
- `--report-out`: Destination path for the evaluation report.

### 2. Evaluating or Inference

Run classification on new images:

```bash
python testing.py   --model models/id_classifier.joblib   --image-path PATH/TO/new_image.jpg
```

This will output the predicted label and its confidence score.

## üìä Model Details

- **Preprocessing**: (If applicable) images are resized, normalized, and, optionally, augmented (flip, rotate, brightness adjustments).
- **Architecture**: Utilizes a CNN backbone (e.g., ResNet, MobileNet), followed by fully connected layers for classification.
- **Training**: Uses typical settings such as Adam optimizer, cross-entropy loss, learning rate scheduling, and early stopping.

---

## üìà Evaluation Metrics

The training process generates a **classification report**, including:

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision / Recall / F1-Score** per class
- **ROC AUC** (if applicable)
- A detailed confusion matrix
